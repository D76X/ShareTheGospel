        There is <b>nothing</b> we can do to deserve to go to Heaven and live there forever, 
        none of us deserves such immensely valuable reward. It is not for sale, it cannot be 
        earned, it is a gift purchased for us out of love and as such all we could do is to 
        accept it with thankfulness and love back the giver.
    </li>
    <li>
        None of us is a good person even if many, wrongly, think they are. <b>God is a perfect judge</b> 
        and looks at us through the 10 Commandments and sees through our hearts and minds. He knows our 
        intentions, thoughts and motives and there is no way to hide anything or keep any secrets from Him, 
        all we have ever done and all we have ever thought is known to Him as in daylight. 
        He will not stand with anything or anyone in injustice, dishonor, lies, deception, thievery, perversion, 
        wickedness, selfishness, pride, anger or any trace of moral corruption. 
        <b>All people will be perfectly judged when they die whether they like it or not,</b> 
        <b>whether they believe it or not</b> the same way any guilty criminal will have to face a court of law, 
        be judged and sentenced even if they acknowledge neither the judge nor the law. There is no escape but
        to be pardoned, not escape either than His forgiveness. But how can we forgive by Him?

            Understand that you are guilty in His eyes. 
            
            If you have ever in your life:
            <ul>
                <li>boasted or lied even with a small, white or business lie, you are a liar.</li>
                <li>been angry or hated someone, you are murderer.</li>
                <li>taken anything that belonged to someone else, irrespective of its value, you are a thief.</li>
                <li>looked with lust at a woman or a man other than your spouse i.e. you have watched pornography, or had sex before marriage, you are an adulterer.</li>
                <li>had sex with a person of your same gender (this is <b>different</b> from same-sex attraction!)</li>
                <li>put anything or anyone before Him who has given you life, you are an idolater.</li>
                <li>used His name in vain even with the popular expression "OMG", you are a blasphemer and have proven to Him you do not love and respect Him.</li>
                <li>have failed to love others as yourselves, you will be found lacking.</li>
                <li>considered yourself a good person, when clearly you're not according to His standards, then you have been also proud and self-righteous which is a sin in God's eyes.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        You are given the opportunity and the choice to <b>confess Him</b> all your sins and <b>truly repent</b> 
        and turn from them <b>today and forever!</b> This means that you must give all sin up all and turn your 
        life, heart, mind and soul to Him. You can ask Him to make you stop desiring, doing and enjoying what is 
        wrong and to change you to desires to do what He wants, what is right in His eyes and not what you want.
        Your obedience, your seeking Him, your relying on Him and entrusting your life to Him, your prayers for 
        forgiveness and guidance when you fail and fall, will be proof to Him that, despite your human weakness,
        you love Him and you put your faith in Him and neither in yourself nor in any of the many evils and deceptions 
        of this World.
    </li>
    <li>
        This is possible because Jesus paid the price of your sin on the cross on your behalf so that you can repent
        and be completely forgiven, without having to pay any penalty yourself because He did it for you. All that is
        left to you is to put your trust in Jesus the son of God, believe Him, have faith in Him, listen to Him and
        accept Him as your savior. This will your sign of love for Him and be attributed to you as your righteousness.
        All your gilt before God will be forgiven, your punishment will be turned into your reward as you have conformed 
        to His will.
    </li> 
    <li>
        If you do this all with all your heart you will be completely forgiven, and He will give you, a new righteous heart
        with new desires. <b>Your faith will save you from deserved damnation and eternal punishment,</b> and when you die 
        you will receive eternal life in Heaven with Jesus and all His saints, as a free gift. There will be no death, 
        no tears, no pain or suffering, no wrongs or injustice, no time, only unbound and everlasting joy, love and life!
